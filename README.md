# BootNTR

Boots NTR CFW.


# Home Menu Analysing Project


Please help us to analyse the home menu from various regions and firmwares in order to enhance the compatibility.

An automatic tool for analysing home menu is available at tools folder.

Usage: a pidf.dmp file will be generated when the NTR CFW is attempting to load with an unknown version of home menu, copy the pidf.dmp to tools folder, then execute process_homemenu.bat. (Python 2.7 is required, may not workable with python 3.x. )

Please send us the result.txt along with your console's firmware version (both emunand/sysnand) and **"kversion"** displayed on the BootNTR by opening issues or sending e-mails to cell9@yandex.com. Do not send the *.dmp files directly.
